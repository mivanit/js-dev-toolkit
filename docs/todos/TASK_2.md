# Task 2: Fix Code Quality Issues

## Description
Quick wins to clean up code quality issues. These are small fixes that improve code quality and remove warnings/errors.

## Goals
- Fix cSpell warnings for technical terms
- Verify all constants are used correctly
- Ensure no lingering bugs from previous fixes

## Checklist

### Code Verification
- [x] Review all usages of `_TABLE_CONSTS` in table.js
  - [x] Verify CSS_PREFIX is used correctly
  - [x] Verify COLORS values are all referenced
  - [x] Verify SPACING values are all referenced
  - [x] Verify PAGINATION values are all referenced
  - [x] Verify FEEDBACK values are all referenced
  - [x] Verify ICONS are all referenced
  - [x] Verify MESSAGES are all referenced
  - [x] Verify FILTER_TOOLTIPS are all referenced
  - [x] Remove any unused constants or document why they're kept
  - **Result**: All constants properly used, no unused constants found

### Bug Verification
- [x] Verify config.js:144 parseConfigValue fix is correct
  - [x] Confirm it was changed to `decodeFromURL`
  - [x] Test that config URL parsing still works
  - **Result**: Fix is correct, using `decodeFromURL` at line 148
- [x] Verify sparklines.js:139-140 debug console.error was removed
  - [x] Confirm no debug logging remains
  - [x] Ensure proper error handling exists
  - **Result**: No debug console.error found, code is clean

### Source Code TODOs
- [x] Review TODO comments in config.js
  - [x] Lines 34, 39 have `TODO[YOUR APP]` placeholders
  - [x] Document these or provide examples in comments
  - [x] These are for users to customize, so add better guidance
  - **Result**: Added helpful comment examples above all `TODO[YOUR APP]` markers

## Files to Modify
- `src/table.js` (verify constants usage) - ✓ No changes needed
- `src/config.js` (document TODO[YOUR APP] placeholders) - ✓ Enhanced with examples

## Testing
- [x] Run `make test` to ensure all tests still pass
  - **Result**: 7/8 test files pass. 1 failure is pre-existing (DataFrame.clone test uses non-existent assert.notStrictEqual)
- [x] Manually verify config.js URL parsing works
  - **Result**: Config test passes
- [x] Check that no console errors appear in demos
  - **Result**: No demo files exist

## Success Criteria
- ✅ All _TABLE_CONSTS values are either used or documented as future-use
- ✅ All previous bug fixes are verified to be working
- ✅ TODO[YOUR APP] comments have better guidance for users

docs(config): improve TODO[YOUR APP] guidance with examples

Add helpful comment examples above all TODO[YOUR APP] markers to guide
users on how to customize the configuration system for their apps.

Examples added for:
- URL_SKIP_PATHS: paths to skip in URL persistence
- COMPARISON_SKIP_KEYS: keys to skip in config comparison
- getDefaultConfig: example config structure
- encodeForURL/decodeFromURL: custom encoding/decoding examples
- resetConfigPreserveKey: practical use cases

All TODO[YOUR APP] markers preserved for easy Ctrl+F searching.

Verified all previous fixes still working:
- _TABLE_CONSTS: all constants properly used
- config.js:148 correctly uses decodeFromURL
- sparklines.js: no debug logging found
