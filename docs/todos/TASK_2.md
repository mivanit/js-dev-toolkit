# Task 2: Fix Code Quality Issues

## Description
Quick wins to clean up code quality issues. These are small fixes that improve code quality and remove warnings/errors.

## Goals
- Fix cSpell warnings for technical terms
- Verify all constants are used correctly
- Ensure no lingering bugs from previous fixes

## Checklist

### Code Verification
- [ ] Review all usages of `_TABLE_CONSTS` in table.js
  - [ ] Verify CSS_PREFIX is used correctly
  - [ ] Verify COLORS values are all referenced
  - [ ] Verify SPACING values are all referenced
  - [ ] Verify PAGINATION values are all referenced
  - [ ] Verify FEEDBACK values are all referenced
  - [ ] Verify ICONS are all referenced
  - [ ] Verify MESSAGES are all referenced
  - [ ] Verify FILTER_TOOLTIPS are all referenced
  - [ ] Remove any unused constants or document why they're kept

### Bug Verification
- [ ] Verify config.js:144 parseConfigValue fix is correct
  - [ ] Confirm it was changed to `decodeFromURL`
  - [ ] Test that config URL parsing still works
- [ ] Verify sparklines.js:139-140 debug console.error was removed
  - [ ] Confirm no debug logging remains
  - [ ] Ensure proper error handling exists

### Source Code TODOs
- [ ] Review TODO comments in config.js
  - [ ] Lines 34, 39 have `TODO[YOUR APP]` placeholders
  - [ ] Document these or provide examples in comments
  - [ ] These are for users to customize, so add better guidance

## Files to Modify
- `src/table.js` (verify constants usage)
- `src/config.js` (document TODO[YOUR APP] placeholders)

## Testing
- [ ] Run `make test` to ensure all tests still pass
- [ ] Manually verify config.js URL parsing works
- [ ] Check that no console errors appear in demos

## Success Criteria
- All _TABLE_CONSTS values are either used or documented as future-use
- All previous bug fixes are verified to be working
- TODO[YOUR APP] comments have better guidance for users
